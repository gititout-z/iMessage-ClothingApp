# Clothing App for iMessage Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
- Xcode 14.0 or later
- iOS 16.0 or later
- Apple Developer account
- iCloud CloudKit enabled

## Setup Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iMessage-ClothingApp.git
cd iMessage-ClothingApp
```

### 2. Configure the Project

#### Bundle Identifier
1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Select the project in the Project Navigator
3. Select the MessagesExtension target
4. Under the "General" tab, update the Bundle Identifier to your own
5. Do the same for any other targets in the project
**Note:** The listed identifiers (e.g., `com.yourcompany.clothingapp.messages`, `iCloud.com.yourcompany.clothingapp`) are placeholders and **must be updated** with your own unique identifiers.

#### Signing & Capabilities
1. Under the "Signing & Capabilities" tab, select your Team
2. Ensure the following capabilities are enabled:
   - App Groups
   - CloudKit
   - Sign in with Apple

#### CloudKit Configuration
1. Go to the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com)
2. Navigate to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles
3. Select your App ID
4. Enable iCloud services with CloudKit
5. Create an iCloud Container with the same identifier as in the project
**Note:** The listed identifiers (e.g., `com.yourcompany.clothingapp.messages`, `iCloud.com.yourcompany.clothingapp`) are placeholders and **must be updated** with your own unique identifiers.
6. Configure the CloudKit Dashboard with the schema provided in `CloudKitSchema.json`

#### Project File Integrity Note
The original Xcode project file (`.pbxproj`) was found to be corrupted or missing. A new project file (`project-new.pbxproj`) has been generated by analyzing the existing source files. To open the project in Xcode:
1. Navigate to `Project Files/iMessage-ClothingApp.xcodeproj/` in Finder.
2. Right-click (or Control-click) on `iMessage-ClothingApp.xcodeproj` and select "Show Package Contents".
3. You will see `project-new.pbxproj`. If a file named `project.pbxproj` exists, delete it or rename it (e.g., to `project.pbxproj-old`).
4. Rename `project-new.pbxproj` to `project.pbxproj`.
5. You should now be ableable to open `iMessage-ClothingApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode.

#### Unit Test Target Setup
To enable running and writing unit tests:
1. A placeholder directory `iMessage-Extension/MessagesExtensionTests/` and sample test files (`MessagesExtensionTests.swift`, `Info.plist`) have been created.
2. In Xcode, manually add a new Unit Test Target to the project (File > New > Target... > iOS > Unit Testing Bundle).
3. Name it (e.g., `MessagesExtensionTests`) and ensure it's configured to test your main `MessagesExtension` target.
4. Once Xcode creates the target, you can delete any default files it adds and then add the existing files from the `iMessage-Extension/MessagesExtensionTests/` directory to this new test target's 'Compile Sources' build phase.

### 3. Configure Info.plist
1. Update the `CFBundleDisplayName` if you want to change the app name
2. Review and update the privacy description strings for camera and photo library access

### 4. Build and Run
1. Select an iOS simulator or device
2. Build and run the project
3. The app should appear in the Messages app drawer

## Troubleshooting

### App Not Appearing in Messages
1. Ensure the Messages app is running
2. Pull down the app drawer to refresh
3. Check that the app is enabled in Messages settings

### CloudKit Errors
1. Verify your Apple Developer account has iCloud enabled
2. Check that the CloudKit container is properly configured
3. Ensure the schema matches the one in `CloudKitSchema.json`

### Sign in with Apple Issues
1. Verify the capability is enabled in Xcode
2. Check the entitlements file
3. Ensure your Apple Developer account has Sign in with Apple enabled
